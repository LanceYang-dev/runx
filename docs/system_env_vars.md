RunX System Environmental Variables
===================================

RunX reads parameters via special environmental variables of the container, found in its *config.json*. They are meant to be set by the user; they do not come with the container. The user can use common mechanisms to add environmental variables offered by containers engines, for instance:

    containerd-ctr run --env XLCONF="/root/test.cfg" --no-pivot -t docker.io/arm64v8/alpine:latest t1 /bin/sh

This command ends up adding a *XLCONF* environmental variable which is read and parsed by RunX. The meaning of these variables is described in this document.


XLCONF
------

The XLCONF variable points to a file in the host filesystem (not the container filesystem) with parameters that are added *as is* to the xl config file generated by RunX. It can be used to modify the amount of memory, the number of vcpus, or any other VM parameter. It can also be used to add device assignment information.
